# Command Line Sokoban Style
A Sokoban-style puzzle game that is played through the command line interface. 

Controls are listed at the top, although pressing "h" for help/hints currently doesn't work.

Game objects are color coded, for ease of use. For example, all lever-related objects are blue, and all key-related objects are yellow.


Objects are as follows:

B: Rock - A pushable object that can also be used to activate a pressure plate.

K: Key - These are used to open key doors.

P: Pressure Plate - When activated, all pressure plate doors will open. The player is not heavy enough to activate these, so a rock must be used instead

S: Stairs - Interact with these to progress to the next level. 

L: Lever - Interact wth this to open all of the lever doors in the level.

T: Wall - Immovable, and impassable.
